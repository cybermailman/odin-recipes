            <li>
                Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce,
                and orange juice for sauce into a saucepan over medium to high heat.
                Stir in brown sugar, green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and
                pepper flakes; bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and cool for 10
                to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in 1 cup cooled sauce. 
              Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Reserve the 
              remaining sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>
                Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned
                flour. Seal the bag and shake to coat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and cover with aluminum foil. 
                Wipe out the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix corn starch and water together until completely smooth. 
                Stir into the boiling sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to medium-low, add the chicken, and simmer, stirring occasionally,
