# odin-recipes
This is a project where I build a basic recipe website. Primarily using the HTML lessons I learned so far from the odin project.
The HTML Lessons that I applied on this project includes text manipulation (bold, italics), incorporating hyperlinks and images into the project, and using absolute and relative paths to navigate from the recipes to the index.html (homepage).
